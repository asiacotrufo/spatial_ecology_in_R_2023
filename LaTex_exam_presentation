\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}{Murgia Materana Regional Park}
\begin{itemize}
    \item\small a protected natural area located at the eastern end of Basilicata, within which there is the Gravina di Matera, a deep limestone canyon, at the bottom of which flows the stream Gravina.
    \item\small this area, inhabited since prehistoric times, is characterized by the presence of around \textbf{150 rock churches}.
    \item \small the park holds approximately 923 vegetational species among which around a hundred are rare and very rare species. This is due to the park's unique erosional grooves which acted as a conservative environment for flora that have disappeared elsewhere.
    \item\small The symbol of the park is the \textbf{Falco grillaio} (\textit{Falco naumanni}), called "u strjsc√¨gnl" in dialect, which often nests on the roofs of the Sassi di Matera.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{National Park of Alta Murgia}
\begin{itemize}
    \item\small \textbf{PnAM} is a national park established in 2004 located in Puglia, in the provinces of Bari and Barletta-Andria-Trani, with an extension of 68,033 hectares, extending into the highest part of the Murge plateau in the north-west.
    \item\small it is part of the larger protection area established to protect the habitat of the Falco grillaio.
    \item \small artificial reforestations of Aleppo pine were carried out over a period of approximately fifty years starting from 1930, affecting the internal areas and coastal strips of Puglia,

\begin{frame}{Habitat and Biodiversity}
\begin{itemize}
    \item\small the human activity over centuries has led to the depletion of woodlands while simultaneously promoting the spread of herbaceous species, resulting in degraded types of vegetation such as \textbf{garrigue} and \textbf{pseudo-steppe}.
    \item \small notable species include the \textbf{Thorny Thyme}  (\textit{Tymus spinulosus}), a rare endemic plant of Southern Italy, and the \textbf{Mediterranean asphodel} (\textit{Asphodelus microcarpus}).
    \item\small The area is characterized by various species of orchids, including the recently discovered species \textbf{Ophrys murgiana}.
    \item\small the arboreal-shrub vegetation is made up of \textbf{wild olive, almond, blackthorn and pear}, among others.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Habitat and Biodiversity}
\begin{itemize}
    \item\small forests are mainly made up of \textbf{oak species, Cypress and pines}, that are home to a rich and picturesque fauna, such as the \textbf{wren} and the \textbf{river nightingale}. Another important species apart from Falco Grillaio is the \textbf{Capovaccaio} (Neophron percnopterus), which is the smallest european vulture, now at risk of extinction.
    \item\small Reptiles includes the \textbf{Leopard Snake} and the \textbf{Common Viper}, while mammals include foxes, porcupines, badgers and hedgehogs, among others.

\begin{itemize}
    \item\small is the third most ancient city of the world, also known as "\textbf{the city of the Sassi}", because of the peculiarity of its historic center (world heritage site by UNESCO, 1993).
    \item\small the choice of the site for the town caused difficulties in supplying water, but since ancient times a complex system of water canalization and collection was created, appearing to be one of the oldest and best preserved examples of \textbf{bio-architecture} in the world.
    \item\small In the late 1950s for irrigation purposes, the Bradano river was interrupted by the building of a dam, called \textbf{Lake San Giuliano}.

\section{Methods}

\begin{frame}{NDVI}
\begin{itemize}
    \item\small The \textbf{normalized difference vegetation index} (NDVI) is a numerical indicator used to assess and monitor the health, density, and distribution of vegetation on the Earth's surface. It is calculated using remote sensing data, typically obtained from satellites.
    \item\small It evaluates the presence of photosynthetic activity, as it relates the \textbf{red} spectrum, in which there is absorption by chlorophyll, and the \textbf{near infrared} spectrum in which the leaves reflect the light to avoid overheating. Index values are typically between -1 and +1, where values close to 1 indicate dense, healthy vegetation.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{4mm}
    \begin{equation} %ndvi
        NDVI=\frac{NIR-red}{NIR+red}
    \label{eq:ndvi}  % to label the equation
    \end{equation}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{FCOVER}
\begin{itemize}
    \item\small The\textbf{ Fraction of Vegetation Cover }corresponds to the fraction of ground covered by green vegetation, so a quantification of the spatial extent of the vegetation. 
    \item \small It can be directly interpreted with the human eyes.
    \item \small Its temporal evolution can be used to monitor the land cover changes (e.g. deforestation or fire scar extent).
    \item \small here we used Daily FCOVER at \textbf{300m} resolution, while the representative date coincides with the end of a 10-daily period (reference dekad).

\section{Discussion}

\begin{frame}{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item\small The relationship between FCOVER and NDVI depends on several factors (vegetation type, canopy structure, environmental conditions...), but it's generally a positive correlation. This is because healthier and denser vegetation (higher NDVI values) often results in a greater Fcover.
    \item\small Both NDVI and FCOVER analysis suggests that, in the area considered, the \textbf{vegetation is in a better condition than before}.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item\small For a better understanding we might consider the weather conditions in the period 2019-2023 (one year prior to our analysis).
    \item\small Datas were taken from Agenzia Lucana di Sviluppo e di Innovazione in Agricoltura:
    \item\url{https://www.alsia.it/opencms/opencms/Temi/attivita/Report-climatici-annuali/}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Discussion}
Generally in these areas rainfalls are concentrated in autumn and spring, while summer is pretty dry. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item\small \textbf{2019}: was characterized buy various hails and storms events, especially in the \textbf{spring/summer} period, this may have affected the vegetation in the following months; \textbf{autumn} was pretty hot and dry.
        \item\small \textbf{2020}: characterized by an \textbf{extremely dry winter}; some precipitation during the \textbf{spring/summer period,} but also a hot and very dry \textbf{autumn} until mid-November.
        \item\small \textbf{2021}: numerous heat waves during \textbf{summer}, warm and partly dry \textbf{winter}; as well as a dry \textbf{spring};
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Discussion}
    \begin{itemize}
         \item\small \textbf{2022}: similar pattern of 2021
         \vspace{2mm}
        \item\small \textbf{2023}:\textbf{ mild, shorter and mostly dry winter} (in January 8.5¬∞ of mean T was recorded, compared to 4.4¬∞ of 2019); cool, unstable and \textbf{very rainy spring}; \textbf{very hot and dry summer} with numerous heat waves; \textbf{hot and very dry autumn}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \small It seems that in the Murgia areas considered, the Fraction of Vegetation Cover and the NDVI index has increased from 2020 to 2023, suggesting an \textbf{improvement} of the extent of green vegetations as well as its density and health.
    \item \small It would be interesting to understand the \textbf{species composition changes} that is occurring in the area, since climate change is expected to have significant impacts on it and also on ecosystem structure and distribution. The vegetation types in these areas range from forests to woodlands, savannas, shrublands, and grasslands.
    \item \small With increasing temperatures and decreased precipitation, generally an expansion of \textbf{scrublands and shrublands} will be favoured, at the expense of \textbf{forests} (important habitats for Falco naumanni) or \textbf{grasslands}.
    \item \small Despite of this, the Mediterranean scrub has a great phenotypic plasticity, which allows it to adapt to current conditions with fewer problems, as well as the ability of the bushes to colonize the soil in extreme conditions.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item\small However, climate change is having significant \textbf{impacts on agricultural systems} and cultivated landscapes in the region.
    \item\small There are documented widespread critical issues related to \textbf{root asphyxiation} and \textbf{fruit splitting }(cracking). In the case of cereals there were evident \textbf{quality problems}, as well as \textbf{phytosanitary} ones, while for vegetable transplants there were delays due to frequent rains.
    \item\small Due to the prolonged drought, even the non-irrigated olive tree was put to the test. In fact, the small amount of cold accumulated so far is creating some concern about a probable \textbf{early awakening or failure to satisfy the physiological needs}, at least for the most demanding species.
\end{itemize}
